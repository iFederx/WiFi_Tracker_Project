EVENT: Application startup  
DO:  
	-Read the file for saved rooms, together with their names and dimensions, and load them all using Context.createRoom(), with create file=false. N.B. The file saving and loading is left to implement!  
EVENT: Station connects to passive socket and pairing completes with success.  
DO:  
	-Call Context.TryAddstation(Station name or station MAC) -> To implement: look if there is a saved configuration for the station. The configuration contains station name, the name of the room in which it is, the position of the station in the room, the interpolators data (they are serializable objects!).  
	THERE IS A SAVED CONFIGURATION:  
		-Load it into a Station object. Pass this object, along the Room name in which the station has been put, to addstation()  
	THERE IS NO SAVED CONFIGURATION:  
		-Open GUI asking for which room  
		SELECTED ROOM EXISTS
			-Move to next point
		SELECTED ROOM DOES NO EXIST
			-Ask for room name and dimensions, and pass them to Context.createRoom(), with createFile=true
		-Update GUI, asking for the position of the station into that room
		-Create a Position object using the constructor with only the x and y of the position
		-Create a Station object, with that position, and the (Station name or Station MAC), and pass it to Context.addStation, along the name of the Room
